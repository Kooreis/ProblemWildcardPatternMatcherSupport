# Question: How do you implement a wildcard pattern matcher with support for `?` and `*`? C# Summary

The provided C# console application is designed to implement a wildcard pattern matcher that supports the '?' and '*' characters. The application first prompts the user to input a string and a pattern. It then uses the 'IsMatch' function to determine if the input string matches the provided pattern. The 'IsMatch' function operates by using two pointers to traverse both the string and the pattern simultaneously. If the current characters in the string and pattern are identical, or if the current character in the pattern is a '?', both pointers advance. If the current character in the pattern is a '*', the function checks the next character. If the next character does not match the current character in the string, the string pointer advances. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns false, indicating that the string does not match the pattern. After traversing the string, the function checks for any remaining '*' characters in the pattern and advances the pattern pointer accordingly. If the pattern pointer reaches the end of the pattern, the function returns true, indicating a match between the string and the pattern.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the C# version. While the C# version uses a two-pointer technique to traverse the string and the pattern, the Python version uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. 

In the Python version, a 2D boolean array `dp` is created where `dp[i][j]` is `True` if the first `i` characters in `pattern` match the first `j` characters in `input`. The function then iterates over `pattern` and `input` and updates `dp` according to the rules of the wildcard pattern matching. Finally, it returns the last element in `dp`, which indicates whether `pattern` matches `input`.

In terms of language features, Python uses list comprehensions to create the 2D boolean array `dp`, which is a feature not available in C#. Python also uses the `count` method to count the number of '*' characters in the pattern, which is not used in the C# version. 

The Python version also uses the `input` function to get user input, which is similar to `Console.ReadLine()` in C#. However, in Python, the `input` function always returns a string, while in C#, the type of the input depends on the type of the variable it is assigned to.

In terms of output, both versions print whether a match was found, but the Python version uses the `print` function, while the C# version uses `Console.WriteLine()`.

# Java Differences

The Java version of the solution is very similar to the C# version. Both versions use the same logic to solve the problem, which involves using two pointers to traverse the string and the pattern. The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in syntax and standard libraries between the two languages.

1. User Input: In the C# version, `Console.ReadLine()` is used to read user input, while in the Java version, a `Scanner` object is used to read user input.

2. String Character Access: In the C# version, characters in a string are accessed like an array (e.g., `str[s]`), while in the Java version, the `charAt` method is used (e.g., `s.charAt(i)`).

3. Print Statements: In the C# version, `Console.WriteLine` is used to print to the console, while in the Java version, `System.out.println` is used.

4. Method Declaration: In C#, the method is declared as `static bool IsMatch(string str, string pattern)`, while in Java, it's declared as `public static boolean isMatch(String s, String p)`. The difference here is due to the different ways the two languages handle method declarations and data types.

5. Incrementing Variables: In C#, the `++` operator can be used before or after a variable to increment it (e.g., `s++` or `++s`). In Java, the `++` operator is used in the same way, but it's more common to see it used before the variable (e.g., `++i`).

In summary, the main differences between the two versions are due to the different syntax and standard libraries of the two languages, rather than any differences in how they solve the problem. Both versions use the same logic and algorithms to implement a wildcard pattern matcher with support for `?` and `*`.
